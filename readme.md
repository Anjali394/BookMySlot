# Slot Capacity Management

Each appointment slot has configurable capacity.

Example:

| Time  | Total | Pending | Confirmed | Available |
| ----- | ----: | ------: | --------: | --------: |
| 10-11 |     5 |       2 |         1 |         2 |
| 11-12 |     5 |       0 |         4 |         1 |
| 12-1  |     5 |       5 |         0 |         0 |

Available Capacity is calculated as:

```
Available =
Total Capacity
− Pending Confirmations
− Confirmed Bookings
```

Customers can only book slots where:

```
Available Capacity > 0
```
